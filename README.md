A Divine Commedy canto generator

The Divine Commedy is a literature work by the italian poet Dante, divided in 3 main parts (cantiche):
- Inferno
- Purgatorio
- Paradiso
Each of those is made of 33 poems (cantos) plus a initial canto as introduction, bringing the total to 100 cantos.
The whole narrative follow the terza rima (ABA BCB CDC DED, may end with EE or E) as rhyme structure and all the verses have 11 syllables (hedecasyllabic). On average, a canto is 142 lines long (about 47 blocks of rhyme).

This project aims to generate new cantos following the rhyme and syllabic structure in the style and theme of the Divine Commedy.
To do that, transformers networks are going to be used.
